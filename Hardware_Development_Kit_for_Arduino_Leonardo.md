This Hardware Development Kit (HDK) for Arduino Leonardo is your easiest way to get started designing an Arduino Uno project.

This kit also includes commonly used components like Atmel 32u4, 16M crystal, resistor, switch, etc.

And the quantity is sufficient for at least 2 prototypes, which can get you out of the headache of purchasing small quantity components.

The parts are all in DIP which can be assembled by hand without difficulty.
